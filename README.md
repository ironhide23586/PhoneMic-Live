# PhoneMic-Live
This project is basically a low-cost alternative to having a proper
microphone system for making announcements etc. in a populated
environment.

It involves a package of 2 applications; One running on the phone,
and the other application to run on the system connected to the
audio equipment.

The sound entering the phone is played through the audio
equipment connected to the system to which the phone is linked.
